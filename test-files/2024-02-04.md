### Your thoughts?

that we are planting seeds in a soil that feels poisoned and infertile


# midnight jaguar

Oh midnight jaguar,
Wash me with your courage, steel me with your grace,
So i may known the value of
The void of time and space
Teach me all your lessons
How to face the dark unknown
Then let me bravely leap
Into the shadows all alone
